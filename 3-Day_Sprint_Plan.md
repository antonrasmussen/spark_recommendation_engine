## Time-Saving Strategies

### Code Efficiency
- **Use provided templates**: Don't write from scratch
- **Copy-paste optimized**: Leverage working code examples
- **Minimal debugging**: Focus on getting results, not perfect code
- **Colab/Databricks**: Use cloud platforms to avoid local setup issues

### Presentation Efficiency
- **Template-driven**: Use provided slide structure
- **Reuse visualizations**: Generate charts once, use multiple times
- **Practice once**: Rehearse timing, then record immediately
- **No perfectionism**: Good enough is sufficient for academic requirements

### Data Strategy
- **Sample if needed**: Use subset of data for faster iteration during development
- **Cache aggressively**: Cache all DataFrames for repeated operations
- **Parallel processing**: Leverage Spark's distributed capabilities
- **Pre-built functions**: Use existing Spark MLlib functions rather than custom implementations

---

## Risk Mitigation & Contingencies

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: Spark environment setup issues
**Mitigation**: Have both Google Colab AND Databricks accounts ready

**Risk**: Data loading problems with split files
**Mitigation**: Start with one rating file, expand to full dataset once working

**Risk**: Model training takes too long
**Mitigation**: Use smaller data sample during development, full dataset for final run

**Risk**: Memory issues with large dataset
**Mitigation**: Implement data filtering and sampling strategies

### Time Management Risks
**Risk**: Getting stuck on hyperparameter tuning
**Mitigation**: Use reasonable defaults if tuning takes too long

**Risk**: Perfectionism delaying progress
**Mitigation**: Set strict time limits for each task, move on regardless

**Risk**: Presentation recording issues
**Mitigation**: Practice once, record twice maximum

## Resource Optimization

### Parallel Work (if team of 2)
**Person 1**: Focus on technical implementation (Days 1-2)
**Person 2**: Focus on presentation preparation and data analysis (Days 2-3)

**Overlap areas**: Both contribute to results analysis and presentation content

### Single Person Strategy
- **Focus on essentials**: Don't implement optional features
- **Reuse examples**: Leverage instructor-recommended MovieLens tutorials
- **Template-driven**: Use all provided templates and structures
- **Time-boxing**: Strict time limits for each task

## Success Tips

### Technical Success
1. **Start simple**: Get basic model working before optimization
2. **Use cloud platforms**: Avoid local environment complications
3. **Cache everything**: Improve iteration speed significantly
4. **Monitor resources**: Watch memory and compute usage

### Presentation Success
1. **Practice timing**: 8-9 minutes target (allows buffer)
2. **Clear narration**: Explain technical concepts simply
3. **Visual focus**: Use charts and code snippets effectively
4. **Professional delivery**: Practice once, record confidently

### Project Management
1. **Daily goals**: Clear deliverables each day
2. **Time tracking**: Monitor actual vs. planned time
3. **Quality threshold**: Good enough beats perfect but late
4. **Submission buffer**: Finish 2-3 hours before deadline

With this focused 3-day plan, you should have a complete, high-quality recommendation system project ready for submission!
